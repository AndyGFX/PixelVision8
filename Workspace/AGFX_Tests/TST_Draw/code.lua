  This project was designed to display some basic instructions when you create
  a new game.  Simply delete the following code and implement your own Init(),
  Update() and Draw() logic.

draw = TDraw:New()

-- The Init() method is part of the game's lifecycle and called a game starts. We are going to
-- use this method to configure background color, ScreenBufferChip and draw a text box.
function Init()

  -- Here we are manually changing the background color
  BackgroundColor(0)

  local display = Display()

end

-- The Update() method is part of the game's life cycle. The engine calls Update() on every frame
-- before the Draw() method. It accepts one argument, timeDelta, which is the difference in
-- milliseconds since the last frame.
function Update(timeDelta)

  -- TODO add your own update logic here

end

-- The Draw() method is part of the game's life cycle. It is called after Update() and is where
-- all of our draw calls should go. We'll be using this to render sprites to the display.
function Draw()

  -- We can use the RedrawDisplay() method to clear the screen and redraw the tilemap in a
  -- single call.

  draw:Pixel(10,10,1)
